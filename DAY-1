OVERVIEW:

difference between statically-typed and dynamically-typed;

Statically-typed:
A programming language is said to use static typing 
when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time. 
In static typing, types are associated with variables not values.

Dynamically-typed: 
 A programming language is said to be dynamically typed,
 or just dynamic, when the majority of its type checking is performed at 
 run-time as opposed to at compile-time. In dynamic typing,
 types are associated with values not variables.
 Dynamically typed languages include Groovy, JavaScript
 
 Programming Language:
 A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings
 that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages
 are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming
 to implement algorithms.
 
 Scripting Language:
 Scripting language is a series of commands that are able to be executed without the need for compiling.
 While all scripting languages are programming languages not all programming languages are scripting languages.
Scripting languages use a program known as an interpreter to translate commands and are directly
interpreted from source code, not requiring a compilation step.
