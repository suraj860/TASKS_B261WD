1) List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs

JS:
1) JS runs only in browser 
2) it is bascially used on clientside
3) Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM
4) It is the upgraded version of ECMA script that uses Chromeâ€™s V8 engine written in C++
5) Javascript is used in frontend development.

Nodejs:
1) NodeJS code can be run outside the browser.
2) It is mostly used on the server-side
3) Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags
4) Nodejs is written in C, C++ and Javascript
5) Nodejs is used in server-side development

2) watch & summary 5 points - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmE4OwHztCc&ab_channel=JSConf
ans:

The video tells about what happens behind the screen when you try to load any websites,
redering,parsing,layout and painting terms are discussed in details which takes place one after another while loading a website.
1) Parsing flow : Their is tokenization that take the text and turn it into what are called tokens that will then create a parse tree which will then create DOM tree 
  with which we can interact with the help of javascript.
  ParseHTML- if we  neglect few html tags while codeing, still the code will work .
  
2) <script> tag is given at bottom so that parse goes uninterrupted through the elements and then create DoM tree and at the end get the script,
    it also help for fast rendering
    css parsing - it will create cssom
    
3)  render- combine two object models DOM+CSSOM figures out all the styles applied,
     and what to show on the screen
     render trees: tey are multiple
     render style: apply styles to the DOM element 
     render layers: tells the position of various layer
     line boxes : handels text ,fon-size ,lineing ,etc.
     
 4)  Layout - it is a recursive process, it will work with the DOM tree ,it lays its children first according to
     their height and width and then flows all the way through the tree.
    paint _ finally has all the info from render tree and gives us the 
    visual output.
    
3) To read - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5641997/is-it-necessary-to-write-head-body-and-html-tags
    we can ommit the tag while codeing ,still it will run correctly, because originally it was added  in a way that the tags would be inferred when missing.
    
4) Execute the bellow code and write your description in txt file
      
      typeof(1)             "number"
      typeof(1.1)          "number"
      typeof('1.1')        "string"
      typeof(true)         "boolean"
      typeof(null)        "object"
      typeof(undefined)   "undefined"
      typeof([])           "object"
      typeof({})           "object"
      typeof(NaN)          "number"
